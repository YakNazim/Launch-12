# Launch Site

Launch 12 will take place at Oregon Rocketry's [Brothers launch
site](http://www.oregonrocketry.com/?page_id=78).  There's not much in
the way of travel services nearby.  Plan ahead!

Access to the site is through a green gate on the south side of
Highway 20E, roughly 40 miles outside of Bend.  The launch site itself
is a few miles farther south of the gate.
