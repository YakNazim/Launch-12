# Geiger Analysis
### Can we detect a differential in radiation counts during flight above ground level?

We had a Geiger counter mounted in the payload bay.

    The correlation (altitude vs. radiation) is: 10.728% with a p-value of: 0.015 (Significant)


## Comments

* This is a very weak positive correlation at 10%...

## Questions

* Does the measurement change when the Nosecone disconnects in that the ground level and apogee measurements are not consistent?
