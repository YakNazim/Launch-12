# Telemetry Quailty

How did our WiFi cope with launch? Each packet sent to the ground has a squence number that we can track. Mising or late numbers means missing or out or order packets. How did we do?



    We recieved 2988 packets during ascent.
    During that period we missed 13 packets.
    So we only lost 0.4% of transmited packets during ascent!
