# Portland State Aerospace Society Launch 12 July 19th

This weekend Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is heading out to the
Central Oregon Desert to fly our "Launch Vehicle 2" or "LV2" rocket for the 7th
time! This launch will be the 13th official launch for the club and has an
exciting set experiments on board.

The launch is scheduled for **10:00 am Sunday July 19th**. Follow

launch info and live launch coverage!


## About Launch 12

![Launch 12 Patch](http://psas.github.io/Launch-12/patch/L12_patch.svg)

Launch 12 will be similar to last year's [Launch-11](https://github.com/psas/Launch-11)
flight, hopefully with many improvements to our ground infrastructure.

This year we participated in [Intel's NUC Challenge](http://nucchallenge.cecs.pdx.edu/)
which allowed us to build an awesome permanent "mission control" table with
many screens and a telemetry & control server.

On board this rocket we have two Raspberry Pi computers with HD video cameras
streaming live footage to the ground over our WiFi telemetry system.

New this year is an important experimental GPS module built by PSAS. We will be
recording raw radio signals from GPS satellites while in flight in order to
better understand the effects of rocket launches on GPS technology.

We have a student designed control experiment that will try and dampen the spin
of the rocket so camera views on the rocket stay steady for the whole flight.

The flight is expected to take the LV2 rocket from ground to 5 kilometers
straight up in 30 seconds. We will break the speed of sound on the way up!

At the peak of the flight parachutes are deployed to slow our descent and
recover the rocket safely.

If all goes well we'll mirror our telemetry in real time this launch! This is an
experimental system, but we hope it will work. During the launch check:
