These are some random ideas for new features I've had kicking around

####Hardware
 - Spincan sensors
 - Rocket body strain sensors
 - Engine thrust sensor
 - Recovery system sensors
   - Nose Cone seperation ring has fired
   - Line cutters fired
   - Photodiode to tell if the nose cone has seperated?
 - Fin wobble sensor

####Software
 - Implement BPF
 - Advanced languages for a more robust system
   - Haskell embedded c code dsl (sodium - reactiveprogramming.org)
   - Idris?
